# Komput

Currently is all held up by the standard library and boost library but things could change.
Good reference to undestand the code could be [Learn CPP](learncpp.com) and [CPP Reference](en.cppreference.com).

## Instructions
To run the different main(s) should be enough to:

```bash
# to build
make <program_name>
# to run
./<program_name>
# to plot (if it exist)
gnuplot -persistent <program_name>.plot

```
## Requirements

Make sure to have the following installed and/or reachable via random `PATH` variables:
* `make`
* `g++ & gcc`
* `gnuplot` for plots
* `boost` for additional functionalities
